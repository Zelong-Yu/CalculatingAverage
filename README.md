# CalculatingAverage
Exercise 2A - Calculating Averages--customized recursive sum and average method
```TestIntRecursiveAvg(List<int> L)``` method is implemented to show how error propogates when use int and do recursive division



Basic Difficulty
Sum of numbers
Create a console application that will accept ten numbers between 0 and 100, and report their sum.


Average ten scores
Create a console application that will accept ten test scores between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.


Intermediate Difficulty
Average a specific number of scores
Create a console application that will accept an arbitrary number test scores (as specified by the user) between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input the total number of tests, then input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.


Advanced Difficulty
Average a non-specific number of scores
Create a console application that will accept a number test scores (as calculated by the number of scores actually entered) between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input any number test scores, and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.
